Drowsiness Detection using YOLOv8

Overview

This repository presents a drowsiness detection system leveraging the powerful YOLOv8 object detection framework. The system is designed to identify and localize drowsiness signs in real-time, such as closed eyes or head nodding.

Key Features

Real-time detection: Efficiently processes video streams to provide immediate drowsiness alerts.
Accurate localization: Precisely identifies facial features associated with drowsiness.
Customizable model: Easily train the model on diverse datasets to improve accuracy.
User-friendly interface: Intuitive interface for model training, testing, and deployment.

Dataset Preparation

Image/Video collection: Gather a diverse dataset of images and videos capturing various drowsiness states.
Annotation: Annotate the facial regions and drowsiness signs in the images and videos.
Data splitting: Divide the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.
Model Training

Configure training parameters: Adjust hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and epochs.
Start training: Run the training script, specifying the dataset path and configuration file.
Monitor training: Track the training progress using tensorboard or other visualization tools.
Model Evaluation

Evaluate performance: Use metrics like precision, recall, and mAP to assess the model's accuracy.
Visualize predictions: Visualize the model's predictions on test videos to gain insights into its performance.
Deployment

Export the model: Convert the trained model to a suitable format for deployment (e.g., ONNX, CoreML).
Integrate with applications: Deploy the model into applications like driver assistance systems or surveillance systems.
Additional Considerations

Data augmentation: Apply data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of the training data.
Transfer learning: Leverage pre-trained YOLOv8 models to accelerate training and improve performance.
Model optimization: Optimize the model for deployment on edge devices or resource-constrained systems.
Continuous improvement: Regularly update and refine the model to improve its accuracy and efficiency.
